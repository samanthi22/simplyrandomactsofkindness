<h2>#freefood - "What are you thankful for this year" - </h2>

<p>During Thanksgiving break we had a chance to be at Berkeley campus in California. In light of Thanksgiving we gave people free bags of potato chips if they answered a question. The question was, "What are you thankful for this year?"</p>
<p>We got 8 difference responses and gave out 10.5 bags of chips. </p>
<p>Right when we entered Berkeley campus we came across 5 guys playing soccer. We were feeling pretty nervous but we offered them doritos. They stopped playing soccer and one guy came over, took one bag for himself and picked up 4 for his other friends. But we were too nervous to ask them the question about what they are thankful for.</p>
<p>So continued meandering into Berkeley campus hoping to find some hungry students. There was a guy on a bike wearing a red sweater gave us our first answer. He was thankful for "friends and family". He did not want potato chips though. A lot of people said they were thankful for friends and family including the next two girls we came across. One of them was also thankful for the opportunities she had in this life.</p>
<p>There was a guy who was wearing ear buds that couldn't hear us at first. But then when we repeated the question he said that he was thankful for "coffee and sleep". There was a guy in plaid who was thankful for "family". There was a girl in green who seemed like a freshman because she was grateful for being accepted to Berkeley and meeting so many friends. </p>
<p>The next guy we met was a little confused about our question because English was not his first language. He was grateful for being in the United States and also for the having the chance to travel a lot this year, including to Algeria. After accepting the potato chip bag he asked us, "Do you want a donation?" But we assured him that all we wanted was an answer to our question. </p>
<p>Further up the hill we ran into a couple. The wife was the more chatty one. She asked us what we were doing. She said she was thankful for "family, friends and life". We asked her if she wanted to take another bag of chips for her husband. But she said, "Oh he doesn't speak English."</p>
<p>Last but least, we came across two guys carrying tennis rackets. When we asked them what they were thankful for, one of them immediately grabbed the other guy and said, "This guy. I am grateful for this guy. He's my roommate and my friend." The second guy immediately added "Him too, but also Tennis."</p>
<p> We still had so many bags of potato chips left. So we opened up a bag of potato chips and a chubby squirrel approached the bag. So we offered three pieces to him and his squirrel friend. 
<h2>#freefood - "What act of kindness have you done for someone this week?" - </h2>
<p>This time we had a banner. We painted a banner with our question using watercolor paints and kids finger paint. We sat on the corner of Shattuck and Brancroft in Berkeley, California with our sign. We waited for people to approach us this time. Within five minutes a thin guy carrying a heavy backpack read our sign and told us that he didn't need any chips, but he thought it was a "Damn good idea to hold people accountable." He said he had done a lot of kind acts this week, including feeding the homeless. Also, he "told the truth on the internet, against all odds".</p>
<p>Then we sat kind of awkwardly on the corner for a while. We noticed that a lot of people would read the sign but not stop to talk with us. </p>
<p>Finally a guy came up to us, walking a pitbull on a long blue leash. He said he could tell us an act of kindness he was doing right now. "See this dog? This isn't my dog. It's my friend's dog and I'm watching it for him while he's in jail." </p>
<p>Our last stranger to share her story was an older lady wearing a snug purple hat. She said that she just been down by the Berkeley Bowl and there had been a biker that fell after running into two potholes in the road. She helped him get back up and so did several other people. Fortunately he was wearing a helmet so he didn't have any major injuries. Before she left she said "I like these random acts of kindness things."</p>
