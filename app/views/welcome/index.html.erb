<h2>#freefood - "What are you thankful for this year" - </h2>

<p>During Thanksgiving break we had a chance to be at Berkeley campus in California. In light of Thanksgiving we gave people free bags of potato chips if they answered a question. The question was, "What are you thankful for this year?"</p>
<p>We got 8 difference responses and gave out 10.5 bags of chips. </p>
<p>Right when we entered Berkeley campus we came across 5 guys playing soccer. We were feeling pretty nervous but we offered them doritos. They stopped playing soccer and one guy came over, took one bag for himself and picked up 4 for his other friends. But we were too nervous to ask them the question about what they are thankful for.</p>
<p>So continued meandering into Berkeley campus hoping to find some hungry students. There was a guy on a bike wearing a red sweater gave us our first answer. He was thankful for "friends and family". He did not want potato chips though. A lot of people said they were thankful for friends and family including the next two girls we came across. One of them was also thankful for the opportunities she had in this life.</p>
<p>There was a guy who was wearing ear buds that couldn't hear us at first. But then when we repeated the question he said that he was thankful for "coffee and sleep". There was a guy in plaid who was thankful for "family". There was a girl in green who seemed like a freshman because she was grateful for being accepted to Berkeley and meeting so many friends. </p>
<p>The next guy we met was a little confused about our question because English was not his first language. He was grateful for being in the United States and also for the having the chance to travel a lot this year, including to Algeria. After accepting the potato chip bag he asked us, "Do you want a donation?" But we assured him that all we wanted was an answer to our question. </p>
<p>Further up the hill we ran into a couple. The wife was the more chatty one. She asked us what we were doing. She said she was thankful for "family, friends and life". We asked her if she wanted to take another bag of chips for her husband. But she said, "Oh he doesn't speak English."</p>
<p>Last but least, we came across two guys carrying tennis rackets. When we asked them what they were thankful for, one of them immediately grabbed the other guy and said, "This guy. I am grateful for this guy. He's my roommate and my friend." The second guy immediately added "Him too, but also Tennis."</p>
<p> We still had so many bags of potato chips left. So we opened up a bag of potato chips and a chubby squirrel approached the bag. So we offered three pieces to him and his squirrel friend.
